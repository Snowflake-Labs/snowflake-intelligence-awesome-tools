# Snowflake Intelligence Awesome Tools

A collection of open source samples and tools that you can use to enhance your Snowflake Intelligence agents or Cortex agents. Each folder in this repository represents a custom tool that can be integrated into your Snowflake Intelligence setup.

## Repository Structure

Each tool in this repository follows a consistent structure:
- **README.md**: Instructions for getting up and running with the specific tool
- **Implementation files**: Notebooks, SQL scripts, or other artifacts needed to deploy the tool

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a tool** that fits your needs from the available tools above
2. **Navigate to the tool's folder** and read its README.md
3. **Follow the installation instructions** specific to that tool
4. **Configure the tool** in your Snowflake Intelligence agent

## Contributing a Tool

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to add a custom tool to this repository:

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Create a new folder** for your tool (use a descriptive name)
3. **Add a comprehensive README.md** that includes:
   - Tool description and use cases
   - Installation instructions
   - Tool parameter table (see format below)
   - Usage examples
4. **Include implementation artifacts** such as:
   - Snowflake notebooks (preferred for easy import)
   - SQL scripts that can be pasted into worksheets
   - Other necessary files for deployment
5. **Open a pull request** - we'll review on a best-effort basis
